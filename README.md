# Hangman!
Hangman game with no graphics. The user can choose from one of three game modes and a random word or phrase is pulled from a list for each game mode. Every guess goes into a letter bank and the userstarts with six lives. The user can play again.

## Note
I first published this repository on October 23rd, 2020 and messed up how I published it. I wrote a note that I would figure out how to use git and fix it. Well here I am now, understanging git better and finally fixing this repository. The original project is located on the main branch (code itself wasn't changed).
