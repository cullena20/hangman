# hangman
Hangman game with no graphics. The user can choose from one of three game modes and a random word or phrase is pulled from a list for each game mode.
Every guess goes into a letter bank and the user starts with six lives. The user can play again.

### note
I'm still learning how to use git and github. I somehow got my beginner projects mixed up in here and will resolve this.
